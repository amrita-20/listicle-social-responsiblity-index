## Notes

One challenge I encountered during development was a data mismatch issue between the server and client. Specifically, the id field in the serverâ€™s JSON response was stored as a string, while on the client-side, I was attempting to compare it against an id that was treated as a number data type. This led to failed comparisons and unexpected behavior.

After debugging, I identified the root cause as the type mismatch between the id values. To resolve the issue, I ensured that both the server and client were consistently handling the id as a number during comparisons, which ultimately fixed the problem and allowed the data to be processed correctly.

## Notes

I faced two major challenges:

1. Port and Host Configuration Issue
The port and host described in the resources provided were only accessible when the application was deployed on Railway. However, when attempting to connect the app locally, the private network configuration failed. After investigation and with help of Guilherme Scotti, I realized I needed to use the host and port of a public network to successfully connect my local app to the database.

1. Database Connection Error due to Environment Variables
Initially, I faced an issue where the database connection was not working, and the error messages indicated a possible database problem. After spending significant time troubleshooting, I found that the actual issue was related to environment variables. The dotenv configuration wasn't loading the variables properly, which resulted in process.env values being undefined. As a result, the database connection couldn't be established. The fix involved correctly configuring the .env file and ensuring it was loaded before the application started. process.env variable was coming as undefined and due to which it wasn't connecting to database
